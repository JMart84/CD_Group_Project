Brewerâ€™s Database



A web application for both professional and home-brewers to use for uploading and browsing beer recipes. Each recipe will have the option to be posted privately so that companies with multiple production facilities will have the same repository for their recipes. Edit and delete functions will be available for the recipes created by the user in session. 

***NEW FEATURES***

We plan to add in comment sections for each recipe, a way to edit account information, a profile picture file upload option, and a drastic overhaul in user interface.
